# Problem description
In an industrial plant it is very important to keep the operation of the equipment under control.
Modern control and instrumentation techniques are applied in the industry to mantain the machinery in an optimal operational state.
As we are involved in an environment exposed to hazards and extreme conditions, it is desirable to be able to detect anomalies from the control room and if possible through automation.
To do this the plant engineers have the data transmitted by the sensors connected to a Carbon Feed Boiler, an key piece for a Process Unit.
The boiler has 30 instruments that measure different variables that characterize the operation status for the equipment.
Being able to detect anomalies in the behaviour of a boiler feeded with carbon is the main task that we want to solve applying Machine Learning Techniques.

# Method
Anomalies detection using Autoencoder taking as input the datalog provided by the 30 sensors connected to a Boiler in timeseries.
